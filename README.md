client is megasoft weird - they make word processessors. 

Looking to build a spell checker 

no word limit
always string input

input => output 

"These words are spnelt correclty" => "These words are ~spnelt~ ~correclty~"
"These words are spelt correctly" => "These words are spelt correctly"
"These words Are Spelt correctly" => "These words Are Spelt correctly"
"" => error
